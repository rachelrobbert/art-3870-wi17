<p>There once was a Princess who feared nothing at all in the world. Not a snake or a lion--not heights or anything else. She ran about during the day enjoying life and not worrying about a single thing... </p> </div>

    <p>
    One day, the Fearless Princess came across a small cloud fairy. This fairy threatened to blow magical dust into the princess' face unless she left immediately. The Princess,  obviously unaffected, giggled at the fairy and stayed where she was. All of the sudden, the cloud fairy  had enough and blew her fairy dust into Princess' face! What would this do? </p> </div>

    <p> However, unbothered as usual, the  Princess decided she might as well continue on with her laughing adventure she was embarking on earlier that day. Out of nowhere, when Princess stopped to look aroud, she realized there was a ghost watching her! "Ha Ha," she said, seemingly unaffected by the ghastly spirit. She continued on with her laughing and giggling.</p></div>

      <p>As she continued on with her day, the Fearless Princess started noticing more and more unusual happenings surrounding her. Somewhat in denial, though, the Princess ignoers what she is seeing. Suddenly, a wild Liopleurodon appears! but I thought these went excinct?" Princess wondered confusedly. However, she laughed it off and jogged on in her trip." Despite her giggling, Princess does notice a growl before she leabes.</p></div>

      <p>Next, the Princess came across a giant goblin with huge ears and stinky breath. "Well look at this friendly guy, " she said.
      "You will give me all of your food from your travels, or else I'll take it anyways!," the Goblin said. Like usual, though, the princess was unaffectd by the monsters she was crossing paths with. She continued on her journey...</p></div>

      <div id="text5">
      <p>Suddenly, as the Fearless Princess comes up on a hillbank, she notices a suction noise. She looks around and sees a huge ocotopus! "Okay, is this real? Or am I seeing this because of that darn fairy?" She wonders. "I guess we'll find out!" She gets a stick and pokes the octopus in the tentacle. "How dare you touch my beautiful blue skin!" The octopus exclaimed at the princess. However, as soon as the giant octupus screamed at the princess, she immediately laughed it off as if it was nothing too important. </p> </div>

      <div id="text6">
      <p>The next stop on the Princess's random journey thorughout the countryside was a trip over the bridge. When th Princess got to the bridge and was going to cross the river, however, the princess noticed an orange fellow under the bridge. He was small and very hairy, and seemed to be growling at her from under the bridge. When asked why, the troll onlyy replied, "because I hate anyone who crosses my bridge!" The princess thought this was funny, though, because she was fearless, and she laughed away as she crossed the bridge over the angry troll.  </p></div>

      <div id="text7">
      <p>Finally, the princess was getting a little tired from her long trip that day, when suddenly a huge roar came from the bushes behind her. "Is this real?" she asks, still confused if it has to do with the fairy dust or not. "Grr! you will pay for what you did!"
        A girant mushroom yells at the Princess. "You've gone about the town making a mockery of everyone's feelings!" The mushroom stated furiously. The Princess had idea that what she was seeing earlier was in  real life. Could it possibly be that the magical fairy dust was actually a potion that would make the princess feel remosre or "fear" for making people feel badly? it is quite possibly so. She thought about this a lot on her way home to her father, the King, all the while laughing.</p></div>

    <div class="zone8"><!--zone eight material-->

      <div id="text8">
      <p>Finally, the Princess has made it back home to her castle! She learned a lot about feelings, and that even if you, yourself, may be "fearless," other people's feelings are serious and are not be made fun of. Th Fearless Princess went back home and never laughed at someoneone unless they were telling a joke ever again.
