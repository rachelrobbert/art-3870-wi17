<div id="intro">
<p>There once was a Princess who feared nothing at all in the world. Not a snake or a lion--not heights or anything else. She ran about during the day enjoying life and not worrying about a single thing... </p> </div>



      <div id="text1">
    <p>
    One day, the Fearless Princess came across a small cloud fairy. She poked and prodded at the cloud fairy, wondering what powers she possessed. The fairy, bothered by Princess' unwanted touching, threatened to blow magical spell dust into her face unless she left the fairy alone immediately. The Princess,  obviously unaffected, giggled at the fairy and stayed where she was, poking and prodding. All of the sudden, the cloud fairy had enough and shouted, "You have ruffled my clouds too much! For this, you will become troubled until you realize what you have done! You must understand..." What did she mean by this? </p> </div>

    <p> However, unbothered as usual, the  Princess decided she might as well continue on with her laughing adventure she was embarking on earlier that day. Out of nowhere, when Princess stopped to look around, she realized there was a ghost watching her! "Ha Ha, very funny. I'm not afraid of you, ghost!" she said, seemingly unaffected by the ghastly spirit. She continued on with her laughing and giggling.</p></div>

      <div id="text3">
      <p>As she continued on with her day, the Fearless Princess started noticing more and more unusual happenings surrounding her. In denial and unfraid, the Princess ignored what she was seeing. Suddenly, a wild Liopleurodon appeared! <br>
        "But I thought these went excinct?" Princess wondered in confusion. However concerned she was for the moment, she laughed it off and jogged on in her trip." Despite her giggling, Princess thought she heard a growl rumbling from deep in the monster's chest, but brushed it off as the wind.</p></div>

      <p>Next, the Princess came across a giant goblin with huge ears and stinky breath.
      "Well look at this friendly guy, " she said. <br>
      "You will not pass by me without paying me one thousand coins! I need money for my new pair of glasses for my eye," the Goblin said. <br>
       Like usual, though, the princess was unaffected by the monster's problem, and she continued on her journey.</p></div>

    <div class="zone5"><!--zone five material-->

      <div id="text5">
      <p>Suddenly, as the Fearless Princess came up on a hillbank, and noticed a suction noise. She looked around and saw an ocotopus the size of a ship! <br>
         "Okay, is this real? Or am I seeing this because of that darn fairy?" She wondered. "I guess we'll find out!" She grabbed a stick and poked the octopus in the tentacle.
         <br> "How dare you touch my beautiful blue skin!" The octopus exclaimed in embarrassment at the princess. However,  immediately after the enormous octupus reacted in shock, Princess disregarded the Octopus' feelings, marked it off as fake and went about her trip. </p> </div>

      <div id="text6">
      <p>The next stop on the Princess's random journey throughout the countryside was a walk over the bridge. When Princess got to the bridge and was going to cross the river, however, she noticed an orange fellow standing below. He was small and very hairy, and seemed to be growling at her from under the bridge. When asked why he was growling, the troll only replied, <br> "Because I hate anyone who crosses my bridge! I'm lonely and upset that no one likes to stay here. They only cross over my bridge!"
      <br>
    The Princess felt bad for a moment, but realized the troll may still be fake, so she ignored it and laughed about as she continued her journey home. </p></div>

    <div class="zone7"><!--zone seven material-->

      <div id="text7">
      <p>Finally, the princess was getting a little tired from her long trip that day, when suddenly a huge roar came from the bushes behind her.
        <br> "Is this real?" she asks, still confused if it has to do with the fairy dust or not.
        <br> "Grr! you will pay for what you did!"
        A giant mushroom yells at the Princess. "You've gone about the town making a mockery of everyone's feelings!" The mushroom stated furiously. <br> Could it possibly be that the magical fairy dust was actually a potion that would make the princess feel remorse or "fear" for making people feel badly? It is quite possibly so. She thought about this a lot on her way home to her father, the King.</p></div>

    <div class="zone8"><!--zone eight material-->

      <div id="text8">
      <p>Finally, the princess made it back home to the Kingdom. Her Father was waiting for her as she arrived.
        "Where have you been, Princess?" he asked in concern. <br>
        "Well Father, I've been on a long trip today." Princess stated in relfection. "I think I've hurt some creatures' feelings, and I've decided I will no longer try to be "Fearless" all the time. Maybe sometimes, my bravery can also be considered ignorance--especially when it comes to other creatures' problems in this world. I've realized I need to be more compassionate, and help out those who need it."
        Princess smiled as she looked at her dad whom she'd travelled to see all day.
        "Maybe that fairy was onto something after all," Princess thought to herself.
