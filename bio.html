   <p> My name is Rachel Robbert and I am an Art Major at California State University, East Bay, in Hayward, CA.
     I am pursuing an option in Graphic Design along with a minor in Computer Science. After playing soccer my entire life and through the college, I have endured some grueling times where hard work was of the essence. However, graphic and web design have proven to be more challenging and rewarding than anything I've experienced. That is why it is my mission to exceed clients' goals, and create a unique brand for each client. While my work is usually done on the computer, I believe drawing is one of the most important factors in being a good artist. This is because drawing allows you to explore ideas quickly on paper, which helps in the process of working with clients to achieve a preferred look. I am proficient in both Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, as well as the languages HTML5 and CSS--and I'm in the process of learning Javascript.
     My linkedin account can be found <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-robbert-68493bab">here</a>, and you may view my portfolio on this website as well as <a href="https://www.behance.net/rachelrobbert"> Behance</a>.
